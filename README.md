# Early-Detection-and-Diagnosis-of-Diabetes-Using-Machine-Learning-A-Random-Forest-Case-Study
This project focused on using machine learning, specifically the Random Forest model, for early diabetes detection. A 75.6% accuracy rate was achieved in identifying diabetic cases, contributing to improved understanding of diabetes development.
# Workflow
A. Data Source and Preparation
This studyâ€™s dataset was obtained from Kaggle, an open- source platform. The dataset, which consists of 9 variables and 768 records, contains data on the factors that affect the early detection and diagnosis of diabetes. The use of this dataset ensures that ethical considerations are avoided.
